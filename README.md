# soopyv2-installer
Updated version of SoopyBoo32's SoopyV2 Installer (https://github.com/Soopyboo32/soopyv2-installer)

Downloads all files from my Github repositories, circumventing soopy's server that is sometimes blocked by ISPs and Antiviruses.

**THIS WILL NOT FIX CONNECTION ISSUES TO SOOPY'S SERVER**

Helps install ChatTriggers, SoopyV2, and SoopyV2Forge.
